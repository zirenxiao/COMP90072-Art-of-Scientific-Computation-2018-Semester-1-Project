----------------------



Current, measured in mA ( i.e 10^(-3) Amps), and associated uncertainty from ammeter ( +/- 2mA)

Counts, the number of decays measured in 100s for that current setting

Corrected counts, due to the deadtime of the detector there is an associated correction to the number of counts. i.e there is a lag between possible detections, so realistically there are more detections than are recorded.

B, magnetic field strength, measured in SI units (Tesla), calculated from the current. Associated syst uncertainty is given in a column alongside this, also in Tesla -- caclulated using the unc. in current 


Momentum, p, in kgm/s, derived from equation (9). 

E total, in J ( derived from the mass of the electron and the momenta). Converted to keV units in the other Etot column. 

T as per page 11 question 

Kurie variable ( experimental) as calculated with the corrected counts and momentum.
